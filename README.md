# Visionarios_player-ball_recognition
Computer vision project, Hope you enjoy!

This project is oriented to be able to recognize both the players and the ball during a soccer match. This is achieved by applying a deep learning algorithm applied to object recognition. In this repository we have the folder "external_test" that contains the test images outside the original dataset "Player and Ball Recognition", the colab notebook "Proyecto_Visionarios.ipynb" contains the code to be executed, and the .py files that are python scripts with code for training the model.
